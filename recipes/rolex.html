  <h1>Rolex Recipe</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    In Uganda, the term "Rolex" refers to a popular street food dish rather than the luxury watch brand. A Rolex in Uganda is a type of chapati (flatbread) wrap filled with a combination of scrambled eggs, vegetables, and sometimes meat.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name "Rolex" is a play on words and is derived from the phrase "rolled eggs." The dish gained popularity in Uganda, particularly in the capital city of Kampala, and has become a common and affordable street food option.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make a traditional Ugandan Rolex, a chapati is cooked and then a mixture of beaten eggs, onions, tomatoes, and sometimes cabbage or other vegetables is spread over the chapati. The mixture is then rolled up tightly, creating a flavorful and satisfying handheld meal.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Rolex has gained a reputation as a convenient and tasty street food that can be enjoyed as a quick breakfast, lunch, or snack. It is often sold by street vendors or small food stalls in various parts of Uganda, and it has become an integral part of the local culinary scene.
