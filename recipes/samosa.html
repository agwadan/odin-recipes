  <h1>Samosa Recipe</h1>
  <img src="./images/samosa.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A samosa is a popular savory snack that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is a triangular or cone-shaped pastry filled with a mixture of ingredients such as potatoes, peas, lentils, onions, spices, and sometimes meat. The filling is usually cooked and seasoned with various herbs and spices like coriander, cumin, turmeric, and chili powder.

    The outer pastry shell of a samosa is made from a thin layer of dough, typically made from wheat flour, all-purpose flour, or a combination of both. The dough is rolled out and cut into circles or triangles, and then folded and sealed around the filling. The samosa is then deep-fried or baked until it turns golden brown and crispy.
    
    Samosas are enjoyed as a popular street food and snack in countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and other parts of South Asia. They are often served with various chutneys or sauces, such as tamarind chutney, mint chutney, or yogurt-based raita, to enhance the flavor. Samosas can be found in different sizes and variations, including vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, depending on regional preferences</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

          <li>1/4 cup oil or melted ghee (clarified butter)</li>

        </ul>
      </li>

          <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
          <li>2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ginger, grated</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala (Indian spice blend)</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
          <li>Salt to taste</li>
          <li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (optional)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For frying:
        <ul>
          <li>Oil for deep-frying</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt for the dough. Add the oil or melted ghee and mix well using your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
      <li>Gradually add cold water, a little at a time, and knead to form a smooth and firm dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter. Then, add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.</li>
      <li>Add the grated ginger and chopped green chilies to the pan. Sauté for a minute, and then add the coriander powder, garam masala, and red chili powder. Mix well and cook for another minute.</li>
      <li>Add the boiled and mashed potatoes, boiled peas, and salt to the pan. Mix everything together until well combined. Cook the filling for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
      <li>Divide the rested dough into small lemon-sized balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle of about 5-6 inches in diameter.</li>
      <li>Cut each circle in half. Take one semicircle, wet the straight edge with water, and form a cone by bringing the two straight edges together, overlapping slightly. Press the edges together to seal the cone.</li>
      <li>Fill the cone with a spoonful of the prepared filling. Make sure not to overstuff it, as it might tear the dough.</li>
      <li>Apply water to the open edges of the cone and press them together to seal the samosa. Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep pan or wok for deep-frying the samosas. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide in a few samosas at a time and fry them on medium heat
