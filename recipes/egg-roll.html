  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>4 sheets of roasted seaweed (gim/nori)</li>
    <li>1 cup cooked rice, seasoned with salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup julienned carrots</li>

    <li>1/2 cup julienned pickled radish (danmuji)</li>
    <li>4 slices of ham or cooked sausage (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a bowl, whisk the eggs with salt and black pepper until well combined.</li>
    <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat and add the vegetable oil.</li>
    <li>Pour a quarter of the egg mixture into the pan, tilting it to spread the egg evenly.</li>
    <li>Cook the egg until it sets, about 2-3 minutes, then gently roll it up from one side of the pan to the other.</li>
    <li>Push the rolled egg to one side of the pan and repeat the process with the remaining egg mixture until you have four rolled omelets.</li>
    <li>Allow the rolled omelets to cool slightly, then slice them into thin strips.</li>
    <li>Place a sheet of roasted seaweed (gim/nori) on a bamboo sushi mat or a clean surface.</li>
    <li>Spread a quarter of the seasoned rice evenly over the seaweed, leaving a small border at the top.</li>
    <li>Arrange a quarter of the egg strips, julienned carrots, cucumber, pickled radish, and ham or sausage (if using) on top of the rice.</li>
    <li>Using the bamboo sushi mat or your hands, tightly roll the kimbap, applying gentle pressure to secure the filling.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients to make three more rolls.</li>
    <li>Once the kimbap rolls are tightly wrapped, slice them into bite-sized pieces using a sharp knife.</li>
    <li>Serve the Korean Egg Roll Kimbap as is or with a side of soy sauce or Korean dipping sauce.</li>
  </ol>
